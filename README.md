## Motivation for the project:

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, many of us are working or studying at home. This applies to both college students and school students.
    An efficient system is essential to ensuring quality and integrity in such a scenario. With the help of various parameters, we propose 
    a system for monitoring the attentiveness of candidates and tracking their emotion levels during meetings/classes to determine a meta-score. 
    Furthermore, our system reports students with less than the threshold meta-score.Moreover, our system notifies health counselors for 
    one-on-one meetings of students with meta-scores less than thresholds. To make the job of health counselors easier, we also generate 
    a custom report of the student by "Intelligent Chat Bot" that can analyze him. Hence, we are creating an eco system that binds together 
    and helps to promote the mental health of students. 


## Tech stack and Modules used:

        React , Flask , Python , NLP ,TensorFlow , OpenCV , Assembly ai
        
        
## AI based monitoring processes:

  Using an artificial intelligence model. The proposed scheme tracks emotions such as happy,sad,tensed,scared 
  and head,eye,mouth movements, which can be converted into a meta-score based on predefined threshold values 
  selected by the authority who conducts the assessment. The thresholds for the two parameters can be adjusted independently, avoiding false results.

## Assembly ai

  Using Assembly ai Sentiment Analysis, can detect the sentiment of each sentence of speech spoken in your audio files.
  Sentiment Analysis returns a result of POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL for each sentence in the transcript.We also 
  incorporate these results to our meta-score.
